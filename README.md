This is the term project for COMPSCI 576 by Ryan Fletcher, Kevin Chen, and Eric Stevens

If you're not launching in the main menu when you start the game or clicking "Start Maze" doesn't bring you to the maze, add both the main menu scene and the sampleScene to the build path in File>>Build Settings, load the Main Menu scene, and unload the SampleScene scene before launching the game.
